# This small script will find and display the 20 most efficient QUALIFIED pitchers 
# in the 2025 MLB regular season through the use of the pybaseball library and pandas. 
# Efficiency is defined as taking on a large workload while maintaining high effectiveness.
# Pitchers who can work deep into games while keeping runs off the board will be 
# ranked the highest. 

# A simple efficiency score metric will be defined as:
# ((K% - BB%) x IP) / SIERA)

# !! Hightlight in post that this is not everything that goes into evaluating a pitcher !!
